# Flappy Bird clone with Phaser3 and Javascript

# Introduction

Flappy bird game with leaderboard system and multiplayer functionality.

# Getting Started
Download and install Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, open VSCODE, drag the project folder to it. Open VSCODE terminal and install dependencies (you need to do this only in the first time)
```
npm install
```

Run this command in your terminal to open a local server at localhost:8080
```
npm run dev
```

# Notes

For leaderboard system I used MongoDB with Node and Express.

I plan to add more functionality and features to this over time it is WIP
